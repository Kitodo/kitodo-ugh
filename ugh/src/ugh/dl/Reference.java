 * A Reference object represents a single reference. A reference links two
 * different structure entites in a non-hierarchical way. A reference may even
 * link structure entities from different structures.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The most common use of a <code>References</code> object is the linking
 * between a logical structure entity (as a chapter) and a physical structure
 * entity (as a page).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * References are always storing the source and target of the link. Besides
 * these two <code>DocStruct</code> elements a type can be stored, to give
 * information about the link.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usually <code>References</code> objects need not be created manually, but are
 * used internally, when creating links. You should use the appropriate methods
 * of the <code>DocStruct</code> class to set linking between
 * <code>DocStruct</code> objects.
 * </p>
